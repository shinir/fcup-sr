## Ransomware

Currently, ransomware is a common term in IT security. It is a malware that blocks access to files of a machine (via encryption), demanding a ransom for data recovery. The maturity of modern cryptographic algorithms ensures that, after encryption, the chance of data recovery without access to the secret key used for encryption is negligible.

### Assignment #1

It should contextualise and motivate the problem in hand, present relevant state of the art work on that topic and perform a comparison of those  solutions/works.
The report must be written using the IEEE 2-column format (you can use this Overleaf template, https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn), with 4 pages maximum, excluding bibliography.

### Assignment #2

The goal is to exemplify how a common network vulnerability can be explored to install a ransomware attack, and implement countermeasures to block the attack.
